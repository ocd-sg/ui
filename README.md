# `ui`

Letâ€™s make life better.

`ui` is a packaged front-end tool to:

- scaffold a project
- single source of dependencies
- allow for dependency and boilerplate updates to be applied to multiple projects even after scaffolding

## Usage

```
npm install ocd-sg/ui
npx ui <react-component|redux-module> init

npm run dev
npm run build:app
```
